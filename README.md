<p> I am seeking like-minded people who stay on the cutting edge of technology. These are exciting times we

are living in today. The rise of web 3.0, 5.0, and whatever else we discover, develop, produce, or 

establish. I beleive this is a great time to be in this field. We get to experience, arguably some of the 

gretest technologies this World has ever seen. </h2>

**Mining-Mike/Mining-Mike** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

With that being said... If you are still reading this, then you are likely to posess the proper skills, knowledge, and/or intellect to partner with me and launch a project. In the next paragraph I am going to tell you about myself and what I do. If I haven't lost you by the end of the next paragraph we may find working together bearable.

I'm seriously going to do my best to keep this short... I have spent countless amounts of time  documenting my own ideas leading to present day. I seem to find more ideas regularly and I find myself writing and typing more than ever before. I am skilled in many areas, some of which may have little or no relevence here. What I believe has the most relevence is my Computer skills. I have been working and learning the Harware side of electronics for almost 20 years. I have attended a few different colleges over the years and acquired papers that say I pretty much know the basics of Hardware and Softwared. However, you cannot measure knowledge in such a way. My experience has given me a wealth of knowledge pertaining to Computer hardware, software, troubleshooting, and repairs. I have been studying Cryptocurrency for the past 3-4 years. My intrest was peaked a little over 2 years ago when I was working at a PC Repair Shop and had a customer come in asking and looking for hardware to build a mining rig.

Not finished yet... to be continued... 

I shall continue here... By now you should have some idea who I am and what I do. If you made it this far send me a message and we can toss around some ideas.
